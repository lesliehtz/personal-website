title: "Tones of Morocco"
date: "2023"
description: "This series is an exploration of the country's arid countryside, focusing on the colors and textures that define the landscape and its relationship to objects that exist within it. Earth tones take center stage, whether deeply saturated, faded, warm or cold, occasionally punctuated by unexpected greens or man-made architectural elements, all under an endless blue sky. Among all these tones, orange has always been my favorite color, so I find myself naturally drawn to it wherever it appears. This work is both a documentation of place and a personal pursuit of a color I hold close."
